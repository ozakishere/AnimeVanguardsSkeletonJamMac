Anime Vanguards Skeleton Jam for mac users.

Disclaimer: Everything including the instructions below were made fully with ChatGPT and Google Gemini. I had to do a lot of debugging and inputting new data though. Also don't be alarmed if you're at 0 points for a bit, it ignores the ones where you hold it as well as sometimes will miss if too fast. You will get the score needed for the quest still though.

Download the .zip file and then unzip it and then RhythmMacro.app will be in your downloads, you can move it wherever you like. Follow instructions below if the app does not automatically notify you of turning on the settings.

When you run this new .app for the first time, it will fail because it doesn't have permission to see the screen or press keys yet. The permissions you gave to VS Code/Terminal do not transfer to this new App.

Drag RhythmMacro.app from the dist folder to your Desktop.

Double-click it. It might close immediately or do nothing.

Go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

You should see RhythmMacro in the list (or click + and find it). Turn it ON.

Go to Screen Recording (also in Privacy & Security).

Add RhythmMacro and Turn it ON.

Go to Input Monitoring (also in Privacy & Security).

Add RhythmMacro and Turn it ON.

Restart the App. Now the GUI should appear and stay on top of your game.
